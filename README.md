# CNN_Image_Classifier_Pytorch
I built a CNN to classify images of flowers into 102 distinct species. I use transfer learning from densenet161, and added my own trained 3 fully connected classifier layer. This is all done using the Pytorch library.

After 5 hours of training I obtained a accuracy of 80% on my test set.
